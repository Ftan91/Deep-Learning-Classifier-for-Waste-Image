### **Problem Statement**
Given the recent headlines around South East Asian countries sending back their trash to developed nations, I've thought of tinkering around with some solutions in the spirit of creating a low-cost AI solution, particularly for waste management firms, to make the recycling process more efficient and simultaneously aleviate the margin pressure of recyclable products.

### **Solution**
As such, the plan  is to construct deep learning model (convolutional neural network) to classify waste images firstly by distinguishing if they are a recyclable or organic item and subsequently classifying them into its individual counterparts such as paper, glass, plastic, cardboard and metal.

As a teaser, final output looks something like this:

### **Dataset**
**Model 1.** For the first model, dataset can be obtained from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/techsash/waste-classification-data). The dataset contains of 22,564 images pre-labeled as 'Organic' and 'Recyclable' items and has been split into 85% train and 15% test. 

**Model 2.** With regards to the second model, the dataset is obtainable [here](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet) with credits given to Gary Thung and Mindy Yang, as images has been painstakingly gathered manually for their final project in Standford's Computer Science 229: Machine Learning class. Hats off to both of them again. The dataset spans across six recyclable classes notably:

- 501 glass
- 594 paper
- 403 cardboard
- 482 plastic
- 410 metal
- 137 trash [will be removed for now as this is not much of a value add to my final model]

### **Setting up Cloud Infrastructure**
In light of my limited computational resources, it is best to set up an account with Google Cloud Platform, for which you will be granted c. Â£231 in free credit (thanks Google!). For low level task, I've ran my notebook purely on 4vCPU with 15GB memory and for training my CNN, I've also added on a NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU for rapid processing. FYI - to be granted access to a GPU, you will need to request access (approvals takes less than an hour). Only advise is to make sure you shutdown the virtual instance for which you are running the notebook in, unless you are keen to be charged for idle time!

There are many useful instructions to get GCP up and running. One I found useful is this video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db4FfhXDYS8).
