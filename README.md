### **Problem Statement**
Given the recent headlines around South East Asian countries sending back their trash to developed nations, I've thought of tinkering around with some solutions in the spirit of creating a low-cost AI solution, particularly for waste management firms, to make the recycling process more efficient and simultaneously aleviate the margin pressure of recyclable products.

### **AI Solution**
As such, the plan  is to construct deep learning model (convolutional neural network) to classify waste images firstly by distinguishing if they are a recyclable or organic item and subsequently classifying them into its individual counterparts such as paper, glass, plastic, cardboard and metal.
